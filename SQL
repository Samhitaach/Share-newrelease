How to Fetch Employees Earning More Than the Average Salary
To find employees with a salary greater than the average:

sql
SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee);

SELECT ColumnName, COUNT(*)
FROM TableName
GROUP BY ColumnName
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;

SELECT employee_name, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
This numbers employees by salary descending, with no duplicates in row numbers even if salaries tie; for example, tied salaries get distinct row numbers.
No Gaps in ranking. Pagination, unique row IDs

SELECT employee_name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_num
FROM employees;
 tied salaries share the same rank, and the next rank skips accordingly (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).The  ties get same rank. Yes,Gaps in ranking since ranks after ties skip.
