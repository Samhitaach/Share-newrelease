A RACI chart is a type of responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) in project management.

RACI stands for:

Responsible
Accountable
Consulted
Informed
Here’s what each designation means:

Responsible
Responsible designates the task as assigned directly to this person (or group of people). The responsible person is the one who does the work to complete the task or create the deliverable. Every task should have at least one responsible person and could have several.
Responsible parties are typically on the project team and are usually developers or other creators.

Accountable
The accountable person in the RACI equation delegates and reviews the work involved in a project. Their job is to make sure the responsible person or team knows the expectations of the project and completes work on time. Every task should have only one accountable person.
Accountable parties are typically on the project team, usually in a leadership or management role.

Consulted
Consulted people provide input and feedback on the work being done in a project. They have a stake in the outcomes of a project because it could affect their current or future work.
Project managers and teams should consult these stakeholders ahead of starting a task to get input on their needs, and again throughout the work and at the completion of a task to get feedback on the outcome.
Not every task or milestone needs a consulted party, but the project manager should consider all possible stakeholders when creating the RACI chart and include as many consulted parties as is appropriate. You should limit this to necessary input, however. For example, one consulted party per affected team is generally considered best practice to avoid clogging the process with too much input.
Consulted parties may be individuals on the project team who aren’t working on a given task but whose work will be affected by the outcome. They’re also often teammates outside of the project team—even in different departments—whose work will be affected by the outcomes of the project.

Informed
Informed individuals need to be looped into the progress of a project but not consulted or overwhelmed with the details of every task. They need to know what’s going on because it could affect their work, but they’re not decision makers in the process.
