Structure of Selenium
1
Selenium is a widely used tool for automating web browsers. Its architecture is designed to provide flexibility, 
scalability, and compatibility for test automation. 
Selenium WebDriver, the core component, follows a client-server model and has evolved significantly from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4.

Selenium 3 Architecture

The Selenium 3 WebDriver architecture uses the JSON Wire Protocol for communication between the client and the browser. 
Here's how it works:

Selenium Client Library: Provides language-specific bindings (e.g., Python, Java) to write test scripts.
These scripts send commands to the WebDriver.

JSON Wire Protocol: Converts commands into JSON format and sends them over HTTP to the browser driver.

Browser Drivers: These are executable files (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) that translate JSON commands into browser-specific actions.

Real Browsers: The browser executes the commands as if a user is interacting with it, enabling automation of tasks like clicking, 
form filling, and navigation.

Selenium 4 Architecture

Selenium 4 introduces the W3C WebDriver Protocol, replacing the JSON Wire Protocol.
This change improves compatibility, stability, and performance across browsers.
The key components remain similar but with enhanced functionality:

Selenium Client Library: Still provides APIs for writing test scripts in various languages.

W3C WebDriver Protocol: Standardizes communication between the client and browser, ensuring better cross-browser compatibility.

Browser Drivers: Continue to act as intermediaries between the WebDriver and browsers, but now leverage the W3C protocol for communication.

Real Browsers: Perform the automation tasks as directed by the WebDriver, ensuring seamless interaction with modern web technologies.

Key Differences Between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4

Protocol: Selenium 3 uses JSON Wire Protocol, while Selenium 4 adopts the W3C WebDriver Protocol for better standardization.

Compatibility: Selenium 4 offers improved browser compatibility and support for modern web technologies.

Performance: Selenium 4 enhances performance and future-proofs the framework with its standardized protocol.

Selenium's architecture ensures efficient communication between test scripts, browser drivers, and browsers, 
making it a robust tool for web automation. The transition to the W3C WebDriver Protocol in Selenium 4
marks a significant step forward in improving compatibility and performance.
