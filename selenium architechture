Structure of Selenium
Webdriver,Client library, Browser library, Real browser
Selenium is a widely used tool for automating web browsers. Its architecture is designed to provide flexibility, 
scalability, and compatibility for test automation. 
Selenium WebDriver, the core component, follows a client-server model and has evolved significantly from Selenium 3 to Selenium 4.

language is not supported by Selenium is ASP.

Selenium 3 Architecture

The Selenium 3 WebDriver architecture uses the JSON Wire Protocol for communication between the client and the browser. 
Here's how it works:

Selenium Client Library: Provides language-specific bindings (e.g., Python, Java, C#) to write test scripts.
These scripts send commands to the WebDriver.

JSON Wire Protocol: Converts commands into JSON format and sends them over HTTP to the browser driver.

Browser Drivers: These are executable files (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) that translate JSON commands into browser-specific actions.

Real Browsers: The browser executes the commands as if a user is interacting with it, enabling automation of tasks like clicking, 
form filling, and navigation.

Selenium 4 Architecture

Selenium 4 introduces the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)standard WebDriver Protocol, replacing the JSON Wire Protocol.
This change improves compatibility, stability, and performance across browsers.
The key components remain similar but with enhanced functionality:

Selenium Client Library: Still provides APIs for writing test scripts in various languages.

W3C WebDriver Protocol: Standardizes communication between the client and browser, ensuring better cross-browser compatibility.

Browser Drivers: Continue to act as intermediaries between the WebDriver and browsers, but now leverage the W3C protocol for communication.

Real Browsers: Perform the automation tasks as directed by the WebDriver, ensuring seamless interaction with modern web technologies.

Key Differences Between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4

Protocol: Selenium 3 uses JSON Wire Protocol, while Selenium 4 adopts the W3C WebDriver Protocol for better standardization.

Compatibility: Selenium 4 offers improved browser compatibility and support for modern web technologies.

Performance: Selenium 4 enhances performance and future-proofs the framework with its standardized protocol.

Improved User Interface: It now has a more intuitive and responsive design. This goes a long way in making test development and execution easier.

Advanced Scripting: It provides supports new locator strategies and offers better support for modern web applications, 
created with frameworks such as Angular and React.

Debugging and Diagnostic Features: Improved logging and screenshot capabilities also enhances the debugging process with these features.
This set of features allows software testers to diagnose and fix problems more effectively, which helps them in reducing time in troubleshooting.

Selenium's architecture ensures efficient communication between test scripts, browser drivers, and browsers, 
making it a robust tool for web automation. The transition to the W3C WebDriver Protocol in Selenium 4
marks a significant step forward in improving compatibility and performance.

Cross-Browser Testing: This make sure, it’s aligned with the W3C standard, that automated tests will execute properly in all browsers.
It reduces the effort that is needed in order to adapt tests on every browser.
